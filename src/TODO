done!

NOTES:

IDEAS:
animals will pray to you and make sacrifices, you get mana from sacrifices
there will be a prompt "X are praying for your protection. Will you answer their call?" and you become their god
you can lose their prayers, if you don't help them or help their enemies

histories for each species
one ability is to fuse two species, mixing sprites, names and characteristics

add randomized battles, where two animals roll dice for who wins, some animals are luckier, but this is offset by other characteristics like reproduction speed

need to make it so that primary death factor is other animals not distance from food!

animals call for help when population is lower than other animals


actually do make plants disappear but slowly
animals can now call for more food
do put sacrifices at the center but make it more of an occasion
